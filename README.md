# Pokécopilot

Pokécopilot is an AI-augmented static website designed to assist competitive 
Pokémon players by providing relevant Pokémon data. Whether you're a seasoned 
veteran returning after a break or a newcomer looking to understand the 
competitive scene, Pokécopilot aims to help you catch up and devise new 
strategies or movesets.

## Inspiration

[Competitive Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_competitive_play) 
was a hobby of mine during high school and university, but I stopped in the 
late 2010s. In that time, two new generations of Pokémon have been added, 
along with a new [metagame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagame) (set of 
most-effective strategies that most players employ).

Understanding the metagame, or "meta", is important when designing, building and battling with 
your Pokémon team. However, adjusting to a new meta can be tough, especially if 
you're returning from an extended break. There is no substitute for playing 
when it comes to learning the current metagame, but an AI-assisted solution can 
help me catch up and devise new strategies or movesets.

## What it does

Pokécopilot is an AI-augmented static website of Pokémon data relevant for 
competitive Pokémon. This includes information like a Pokémon's base stats, the 
moves it can learn, and the abilities it can have. Strategies often revolve 
around using Pokémon with specific movesets and abilities. But Pokémon are not 
made equal. Some popular moves are restricted to certain Pokémon.

Pokécopilot is intended to be used as a reference tool, but with an AI Chatbot 
available to help users look up specific information. For example, users can 
use the website to figure out which Pokémon can learn the move 
[U-turn](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/U-turn_(move)), but determining 
the fastest (highest Speed) or strongest (highest Attack) bug-type Pokémon that 
can learn U-turn takes a little more work. Questions like this can be quickly answered by an Large-Language Model
that can retrieve and communicate this information to users.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Pokémon Data**: Access detailed information on Pokémon base 
  stats, moves, and abilities.
- **AI Chatbot Assistance**: Get help with specific queries, such as finding 
  the fastest or strongest Pokémon that can learn a particular move.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through Pokémon data with ease.

## Getting Started

To get started with Pokécopilot, simply visit the website and start exploring 
the data. Use the AI Chatbot for any specific queries you might have.
